First of all, I would like to say thanks for this task. It was quite a tricky one. I was hoping the task would be something where I need to create backend API along with all configurations and use it in the frontend, fix the problem in the project, etc.


However, I still tried to continue these tasks and take it as a challenge and I'm gonna describe to you what I have tried.


I created an AWS RDS MariaDB instance connect it to MySQL workbench and import the table.sql file into it.


After that, I performed Github actions using the main.yml with every push, Github actions will automatically deploy my index.js file to AWS lambda function.


In the index.js file, I used some npm packages, aws-sdk to configure AWS, Knex to query the database after connecting to database


Destructuring the body and params and use it as query.


All others files and folders except index.js (which has the lambda function), I created just for checking and for fun!


If you want to lambda functions, RDS instance, we can go over with that on a video call!


I would say, if the task would be related to creating backend API and interacting it with the frontend, I would definitely complete my task.


If you want to test me out with that I'm ready also can share the projects that I have done with you


Thanks you!
